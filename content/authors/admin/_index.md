Hi!

I am a postdoctoral researcher at MIT, interested in studying the relationship between language and other aspects of human cognition. In my work, I use tools from cognitive neuroscience (such as fMRI) and artificial intelligence (such as large language models).

To learn more, browse this website or check out this 5-min [TEDx talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDVBjzkcLQg&ab_channel=TEDxTalks) about applying insights from neuroscience to better understand the capabilities of large language models.

You can contact me at annaiv [at] mit [dot] edu or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/neuranna).

***UPDATE***: In January 2024, I will be starting as an Assistant Professor at Georgia Tech Psychology! You can find more information at my lab website, [Language, Intelligence, and Thought](https://www.language-intelligence-thought.net/). I am hiring at all levels, don't be shy to reach out!
